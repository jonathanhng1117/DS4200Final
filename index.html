    <h3>Data Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Our analysis utilizes the Inside Airbnb: NYC dataset from Kaggle called
      `NYC_Airbnb.csv` to conduct a comprehensive data analysis of New York City
      Airbnb listings. The Inside Airbnb: NYC dataset from Kaggle consists of
      over 37,000 observations and 74 attributes, covering both categorical and
      continuous variables. Our final cleaned dataset consists of 37,410 rows
      and 25 columns. The dataset includes essential details such as host
      information, room type, neighborhood information, pricing, availability,
      and guest reviews. The detailed information about the features is listed
      in the following table:

    <h3>Choropleth Map of NYC Neighborhoods</h3>

    <p>
      In this choropleth map showcasing NYC's Airbnb landscape, we've utilized
      Shapely points to pinpoint the precise locations of listings within the
      dataset. By organizing listings according to neighborhood, we offer
      insightful average prices and review scores for each area. Employing
      convex hull polygons, we outline the geographic boundaries of these
      neighborhoods, enhancing them with important details such as average price
      and review score. The color scheme intuitively represents the relative
      average price of each neighborhood, enabling users to swiftly identify
      areas within their budget. Hovering over the polygons reveals the names of
      neighborhoods, while clicking provides comprehensive averages for price
      and review scores. This interactive feature allows potential customers to
      identify neighborhoods that fit their budget and review score standards,
      facilitating informed decision-making.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      Generally, the majority of neighborhoods in NYC offer prices below $250
      per night, though a few, such as Tribeca and Prospect Park, boast average
      prices of $559.38 and $501.50 per night, respectively. Additionally, the
      average review scores tend to be consistently high, with most
      neighborhoods receiving scores above 4.5. The interactive map provides
      users with the opportunity to explore the distribution of prices and
      review scores across NYC neighborhoods, empowering them to make
      well-informed decisions about where to stay according to their preferences
      and budget constraints.

    <h3>Bar Chart: Average Price by Room Type and Neighborhood</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="image">
        <img
          src="average_price_by_room_neighborhood.png"

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The bar chart illustrates the average prices of various room types
          across neighborhoods in New York City, providing customers with
          valuable insights for their accommodation choices. It underscores
          significant price discrepancies among neighborhoods and offers clarity
          on the most popular room types in each area. Each bar represents the
          average price of a specific room type within a neighborhood, serving
          as visual cues that highlight price disparities among neighborhoods.
          The x-axis indicates different neighborhoods, organizing the data
          spatially, while the y-axis represents average prices, facilitating
          comparisons across room types and neighborhoods. This visual
          representation enables customers to easily pinpoint budget-friendly
          options and grasp market trends, empowering them to make well-informed
          decisions tailored to their preferences and budget constraints during
          their stay in New York City.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bar chart vividly illustrates that Manhattan boasts the highest
          average price across all room types, particularly for hotel rooms.
          This observation highlights Manhattan's premium status in the
          accommodation market and highlights the significant price discrepancy
          between this borough and others in New York City.

    <h3>Heatmap: Distribution of Room Types Across NYC Neighborhoods</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The heatmap offers guests valuable insights into the diverse range of
          room types available across New York City's neighborhoods. Each cell
          in the heatmap represents a combination of room type and neighborhood,
          with the presence of a mark indicating the count of listings with that
          specific room type in the corresponding neighborhood. The x-axis
          denotes different room types, while the y-axis represents neighborhood
          groups, offering spatial organization for identifying room type
          distribution. The color of each cell encodes the count of listings,
          with darker shades indicating higher counts and lighter shades
          representing lower counts, facilitating quick perception of room type
          frequencies. Numeric annotations within cells provide precise
          quantitative information, supplementing the visual encoding with exact
          counts of listings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heatmap reveals the prevalence of different accommodation types
          across neighborhoods, with entire homes/apartments dominating in
          Manhattan, followed by Brooklyn and Queens. It also highlights the
          popularity of private rooms in Brooklyn, followed bt Manhattan and
          Queens. This information helps guests align their accommodation
          preferences with neighborhood offerings, facilitating informed
          decisions tailored to their needs and budget constraints.

    <h3>Interactive Scatterplot: Price vs. Number of Reviews</h3>

    <p>
      In the interactive scatter plot below, we illustrate the relationship
      between price and the number of reviews for a random sample of 5,000
      listings. To enhance clarity, we capped the price at under $3,000, as the
      majority of listings fell within the lower price range of $0 to $200.
      However, there were a few high-price outliers around $5,000, which could
      obscure the chart's readability. Each circle on the plot represents a
      listing, positioned based on its price and number of reviews. These
      circles are color-coded to denote different room types.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <iframe
        src="scatter_altair.html"
        width="80%"
        height="400px"
        frameborder="0"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This scatterplot enables customers to evaluate listing value and
      popularity by correlating price with review counts. Additionally, our
      interactive tool allows users to select their preferred room type,
      dynamically scaling the chart to display only listings of that type. This
      feature provides users with a clearer view of the general price and review
      distribution for a specific room type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite our analysis, we found no clear correlation between price and the
      number of reviews, with variations observed across different room types.
      However, the color coding facilitates users in finding accommodations that
      align with their preferences and needs, aiding them in making informed
      decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Interactive Scatterplot: Various Review Score Attributes</h3>

    <p>
      In our dataset, we found that Airbnb listings are evaluated on various
      subattributes like location, cleanliness, and check-in process, which
      contribute to the overall review score. Our interactive scatter plot
      provides a comprehensive overview of overall review scores across NYC,
      allowing users to explore individual subattributes. Positioned similarly
      to a geographical map, each circle represents a listing's location based
      on latitude and longitude. The color of each point corresponds to the
      displayed review score attribute, with darker shades indicating higher
      scores and lighter shades indicating lower scores on a scale of 1 to 5.
      This color scheme aids users in quickly identifying listings with lower
      scores amidst the majority of higher-scored listings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, users can utilize the dropdown menu at the top of the plot to
      select their preferred subattribute for analysis. This feature enables
      users to explore the distribution of review scores based on specific
      criteria, empowering them to make more informed decisions when choosing
      accommodations.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <iframe
        src="scatter.html"
        width="80%"
        height="400px"
        frameborder="0"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Additionally, we've implemented a tooltip feature that allows users to
      hover over data points to access essential details about each listing.
      This includes the listing's name, price, room type, neighborhood, overall
      review score, and accommodation capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a customer considering where to stay can utilize this feature
      by selecting the location subattribute of the review score. This enables
      them to identify clusters of high or low review scores, indicating
      previous customers' sentiments about specific locations and neighborhoods.
      For instance, our data shows that downtown Manhattan and surrounding areas
      like western Brooklyn consistently receive high review scores for location
      attributes. This information could influence a customer's decision when
      choosing where to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar analyses can be conducted using other subattributes, providing
      users with comprehensive insights into neighborhood trends based on past
      customer reviews. Ultimately, this visualization aims to offer guided
      insights into the numerical review scores of Airbnb listings, assisting
      users in making informed decisions regarding accommodation choices.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary and future work</h3>

    <p>The main findings of our analysis include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Manhattan exhibits the highest average price across all room types,
        indicating its premium status in the market. Additionally, entire
        homes/apartments in Manhattan have the highest number of listings,
        reflecting strong demand in this area.
      </li>
      <li>
        The choropleth map reveals that many neighborhoods in NYC offer
        relatively low average prices, providing budget-friendly options for
        travelers. Despite this, there are scattered instances of lower ratings
        across the city, highlighting the need for customers to consider
        multiple factors when making booking decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our analysis suggests no clear correlation between price and the number
        of reviews, further emphasizing the complexity of factors influencing
        consumer choices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Moving forward, potential next steps for research include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exploring the influence of tourist attractions and transportation hubs
        on pricing and popularity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generating predictive models to forecast price and desirability of a
        listing using various features like location and room type.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conducting sentiment analysis on customer reviews to identify common
        themes and sentiments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investigating seasonal variations in popularity and price, considering
        factors like weather, holidays, and major events.
      </li>
    </ul>
